# .NET-II-Final-Project-WhereToWatch-v2.0
WhereToWatch v2.0 is a media search tool that I made for my .NET II Final Project in Jim Glasgow's class at Kirkwood Community College. During this semester we learned
more C#, more visual studio, and xaml. I rewrote a ton of my old code from the previous project and redid all the interfaces in xaml with a new style. The tool itself allows you to search up any movie or tv show you can think of, and be provided various details about the result, and even a trailer link, if available. It accomplishes this by communicating with TheMovieDB's API.

**If you decide to download the project for testing, you must provide your own API Key, sorry.
Add your API Key to MediaLogicLayer/MediaAPI.cs**
